# Forest-Monitoring


This repository is a submission to the Jupyter Notebook Competition oranized by Copernicus.

The objective of this notebook is to guide the reader in understanding and using satellite data through the WEkEO data access platform.

Today, there are many natural and anti-natural disasters affecting forests. There is an accumulation of these phenomena and they are becoming more and more recurrent. I therefore considered the possibility of monitoring and controlling these phenomena in order to act more effectively in the interest of the health of our forests. To do this, I used the Sentinel-2 data provided by the European Space Agency's Copernicus programme.
